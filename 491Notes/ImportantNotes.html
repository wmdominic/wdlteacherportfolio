            <h3>Lesson Plan Writing Tips</h3>
            <h4>Writing Objectives</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The objectives you put on your lesson plan must be taught <em>within</em> the lesson. If it's not within your objective, you cannot assess it.</li>
                    <li>Objectives only state <em>new</em> skills/knowledge students will take away as a direct result of the lesson.</li>
                    <li>Keep the objective to a couple, assess and teach based and focused on those, and if there's something more than needs to be taught, a new lesson can be created to build upon the first.</li>
                    <li>Use Bloom's Taxonomy to write your objectives. The objectives must be <em>measurable!</em></li>
                    <li>When developing your objectives, ask yourself the following information:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the topic of the lesson?</li>
                            <li>What do I want students to learn?</li>
                            <li>What do I want them to understand and be able to do at the end of class?</li>
                            <li>What do I want them to take away from this particular lesson?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>When writing your objectives on the lesson plan, sort them from most important to least important. This will hep you for managing class time and accompishing the more important objectives. Consider the following questions:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are the most important concepts, ideas, or skills I want students to be able to grasp and apply?</li>
                            <li>Why are they importnat?</li>
                            <li>If I ran our of time, which ones could <em>not</em> be omited?</li>
                            <li>Conversely, which ones could I skip if I ran out of time?</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

            <h4>Writing Assessment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessment is <em>not</em> the same as grading.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Lesson Plan Advice from Peers</h3>
                <p>Examples were appreciated in the procedures section. Knowing what you have already covered in previous lessons as well as age and grade of students will help determine where they are in terms of what you should teach them, review with them, or include. A pre-assessment or survey could come in handy to determine where the class lies. Your objective should be reflected directly in your assessment section. If it's not in your objective, it cannot be in your assessment. [Shaina G.]</p>

            <h3>Teaching Speeches</h3>
            <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep in mind your students' worry, ability, and grade level when assigning a speech and the speech length.</li>
                    <li>Keep the speech relaxed. No Big Deal. Speeches can be <em>dreadful</em> to some.</li>
                    <li>Oral citations: where and when source was published.</li>
